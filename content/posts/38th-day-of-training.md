Today I have added added code for sending remember mail and recommend mail.  
now if user click on remember mail button then remember mail will be send to current manager level whose approval is needed.  
Also if a manager click on recommend button then a mail will be sent to next level of manager.  
And make some change in view, controller and models of user create and edit ie.Code is modified for user having no line manager for both create and edit user.  
To edit user data all needed functionality including view, models and controller are add.
