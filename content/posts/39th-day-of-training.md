Now as these are last days of my training I tried to complete my project as soon as possible and tried to increase my speed. Today I have added some required changes in layout of request mail, added sql query to create manager\_levels table in database,as I forget to add it earlier. Also Added code for to delete manager level and update level number of other managers.now if deletion of a manager occur then this code will delete manager level from subordinates managers levels. And update other managers levels.
