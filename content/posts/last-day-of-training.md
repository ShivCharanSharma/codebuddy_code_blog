As today is last day of my six week training. I have perform some patch work like, I have edited setLeave function to create leave by manager on behalf of collaborater. Undo all changes in employee.php because they cause problem in different functionality. Updated link of popup in create and edit user views.And changed views/hr/createleave.php to recommend leave. Then I submit my work as some part of my project need some modification so I will tried to make these change as soon as possible and my six week training ends :)
